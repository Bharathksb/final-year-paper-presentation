Software Bug Prediction System Using Random Forest Algorithm
Overview
An innovative software bug prediction system that employs Random Forest (RF) algorithm to predict software bugs with enhanced accuracy compared to traditional Logistic Regression (LR) approaches. This system helps in early detection of software bugs, thereby improving software quality, reducing development costs, and minimizing security threats.
🎯 Key Features

High Accuracy: Achieves 78.59% accuracy with Random Forest vs 76.54% with Logistic Regression
Advanced ML Algorithms: Implements both Random Forest and Logistic Regression for comparative analysis
Statistical Validation: Results validated with 95% confidence interval and p<0.05 significance
Security Enhancement: Helps avoid security threats through early bug detection
Comprehensive Metrics: Analyzes software metrics including lines of code, code churn, and code complexity
